//Question 1:

//What is the best way to write a for loop in swift?

//Choice A:
for var i = 0; i < 5; i++ {
  print("Hello!")
}

//Choice B: - Closed Operator 
for _ in 0...4 {
  print("Hello!")
}


//Choice B is better, it performs the same actions as choice A but in less declarations of variables.
